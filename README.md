Part 1 (initial study)

Introduction

Sometimes when I have a phone call with others, I need to write down a phone number, some addresses or other content. Sometimes I also need to save important phone call to review to remind me to do sth. This app is designed to help people with those similar needs. Itâ€™s free and without any limits.

Yes, it's helpful if there is a good call recording app.

light weighted apps, easy to backup your recordings.

User Interface is not good. don't like advertisement. good to have cloud storage.

need a call recording app.
free, no bugs, and simple UI
don't like advertising and other limits


Part 2 (what changed)

Since users like simple UI, I decide to only have one main call history UI, and one settings UI.
do not set any limits, like recording numbers or time, and support cloud storage as many as possible.
